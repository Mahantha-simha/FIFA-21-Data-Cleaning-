🔍 Project Overview
I worked on a data-cleaning project using Pandas, NumPy, and Regex to preprocess and transform FIFA 21 player data. The dataset contained 18,278 rows and 104 columns, requiring extensive cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy for further analysis.

⚡ Key Tasks & Transformations
✅ Removed unnecessary whitespace and special characters from categorical columns.
✅ Extracted contract details, including start date, end date, contract length, and contract status.
✅ Converted height (feet/inches → cm) and weight (lbs → kg) for standardization.
✅ Handled missing values and replaced non-standard null values with NaN.
✅ Processed loan date end data to separate it from contract details.
✅ Cleaned W/F, SM, and IR ratings by removing unwanted symbols.
✅ Transformed numerical values (e.g., "K" in Hits column → thousands for accuracy).
✅ Saved the cleaned dataset for further EDA & machine learning applications.

📊 Results & Impact
This project significantly improved data quality, consistency, and usability, making the dataset ready for further insights, visualizations, and predictive modeling.
